# Explanation of Methods Used in Multiprocessing Problems

Here are the key methods and techniques used in the multiprocessing solutions, along with their explanations:

## 1. `Process`
- **Description**: Used to create and manage individual processes.
- **How It Works**: You create a `Process` object and specify the target function and its arguments. Start the process with `.start()` and wait for it to complete with `.join()`.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from multiprocessing import Process

  def print_message(msg):
      print(msg)

  p = Process(target=print_message, args=("Hello, World!",))
  p.start()
  p.join()
  ```

## 2. `Pool`
- **Description**: Provides a convenient way to parallelize tasks over multiple processes.
- **Common Methods**:
  - `map`: Distributes tasks across multiple processes and collects results.
  - `starmap`: Similar to `map`, but allows passing multiple arguments to the target function.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from multiprocessing import Pool

  def square(x):
      return x * x

  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  with Pool(2) as pool:
      results = pool.map(square, numbers)

  print("Squares:", results)
  ```

## 3. `Value`
- **Description**: A shared variable between processes.
- **How It Works**: Use `Value` to create a shared memory object that processes can safely access and modify.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from multiprocessing import Value

  counter = Value('i', 0)  # Shared integer initialized to 0
  print("Initial Value:", counter.value)
  ```

---

## 4. `Lock`
- **Description**: Ensures that only one process accesses a shared resource at a time.
- **How It Works**: Wrap operations on shared resources in `with lock:` to prevent race conditions.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from multiprocessing import Lock

  lock = Lock()
  with lock:
      print("This section is thread-safe.")
  ```

---

## 5. `Queue`
- **Description**: A thread/process-safe way to share data between processes.
- **How It Works**: Use `.put()` to add items to the queue and `.get()` to retrieve them.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from multiprocessing import Queue

  q = Queue()
  q.put(42)
  print("Retrieved:", q.get())
  ```

---

## 6. `shutil.copy`
- **Description**: Copies files from one location to another.
- **How It Works**: Specify the source and destination file paths.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import shutil
  shutil.copy("source.txt", "destination.txt")
  ```

---

## 7. `Pillow` (PIL)
- **Description**: A library for image processing.
- **How It Works**: Open an image, apply operations (e.g., resizing), and save it.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from PIL import Image
  img = Image.open("image.jpg")
  img = img.resize((100, 100))
  img.save("resized.jpg")
  ```

---

## 8. `requests.get`
- **Description**: Fetches data from a URL.
- **How It Works**: Sends a GET request to the URL and returns the response.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import requests
  response = requests.get("http://example.com")
  print(response.text)
  ```

---

## 9. `random.random`
- **Description**: Generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.
- **How It Works**: Use `random.random()` to generate the number.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import random
  print(random.random())
  ```

---

## 10. Monte Carlo Simulation Logic
- **Description**: A statistical method to estimate a value (e.g., π) using random sampling.
- **How It Works**: Generate random points and determine how many fall within a specific area (e.g., a circle).
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import random
  inside_circle = 0
  total_points = 1000

  for _ in range(total_points):
      x, y = random.random(), random.random()
      if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:
          inside_circle += 1

  pi_estimate = (4 * inside_circle) / total_points
  print("Estimated π:", pi_estimate)
  ```
